# Learning GitHub Actions

This repository is to learning and exploring GitHub Actions, a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub. GitHub Actions allows you to automate various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying your code, directly from your GitHub repository.

I've also tried to add multiple trigger events, workflows, event filters, activity types to understand how GitHub Actions work.
